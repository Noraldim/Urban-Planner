## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Semantic Segmentation** of satellite imagery to identify empty land suitable for construction. Using deep learning, we compare multiple state-of-the-art architectures (**U-Net** vs. **DeepLabV3+**) across various powerful backbones (**ResNet, VGG16, Xception, EfficientNet**).

The final output is not just a mask, but a **Smart City Plan** generated by an algorithmic planner that automatically distributes buildings (Hospitals, Stadiums, Malls) onto the detected empty land based on urban planning rules.

## Dataset
* **Source:** Custom Satellite Imagery Dataset (PASTIS/Fixed).
* **Input Size:** 160x160 (Resized for compatibility with ResNet/VGG pooling layers).
* **Classes:** Binary Segmentation.
    * **0 (Black):** Occupied/Non-buildable area.
    * **1 (White):** Empty/Buildable land.
* **Preprocessing:** Images were normalized and processed according to the specific requirements of each backbone (e.g., `preprocess_input` for ResNet vs VGG).

## Model Architectures & Experimentation

We conducted a rigorous comparison between two primary segmentation architectures with various pre-trained encoders (backbones).

### 1. U-Net (Encoder-Decoder)
U-Net is the standard for medical and fine-grained segmentation. We trained it using **ResNet34**, **ResNet101**, and **VGG16**.

### 2. DeepLabV3+ (Spatial Pyramid Pooling)
DeepLabV3+ uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale context. We trained custom implementations using multiple backbones.

> **Key Findings:**
> * **DeepLabV3+ (EfficientNetB5)** achieved the highest overall accuracy due to its robust feature extraction.
> * **U-Net (VGG16)** performed exceptionally well on boundaries but required significantly more GPU memory.
> * **Xception** offered the best balance between speed and accuracy.

## Application: The Smart City Planner
Beyond segmentation, this repository includes a post-processing algorithm that takes the AI-generated mask and plans a city layout.

### How it Works:
1.  **Land Analysis:** Calculates total available square meters from the mask.
2.  **Feasibility Check:** Compares available land vs. required land for the blueprint.
3.  **Conflict-Free Placement:** Uses a randomized spatial search to place buildings without overlapping existing structures or detecting collision with boundaries.
4.  **Priority Handling:** Prioritizes critical infrastructure (Hospitals, Stadiums) before placing residential units.

### Blueprint Config
The system currently places:
* 🏟️ **Stadiums** (Red)
* 🏥 **Hospitals** (Cyan)
* 🛍️ **Malls** (Magenta)
* 🕌 **Mosques** (Yellow)
* 🏠 **Residential Units** (Green)
